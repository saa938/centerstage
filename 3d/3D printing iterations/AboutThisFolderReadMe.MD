I uploaded all the iterations of all of the different designs to this folder.

To navigate:

1: Find which part you are looking for and navigate to that folder.
2: In the folder, there will be all the dates of iterations, and in parentheses how many iterations are inside.
3: Each STL file has three parts. The first is a abbreviation of the part. The second is the date. The third is the iteration number for that day.

The newest iteration will be on the latest day, and have the highest iteration number on the day.
